You're disturbed. 


I have bad news. You're never gonna find something that doesn't exist. How much longer do you need to face the obvious facts? 1. u 2. austin --- adults. 

My computer ... google accounts, all my emails, githubs, icloud... Everywhere clean. 

I don't need you to have a good opinion about me. But I mean... Are you seriously going to remain delusional on purpose? Evidence supports me. NOTHING besides your opinion supports you. 

It's simple math.
